title: Welcome to my Blog!

Hi! I'm John, a Canadian uni student. My primary research interests are machine learning (especially reinforcement learning) and operations research (especially revenue management & dynamic pricing). Pretty much all of my blog posts will cover one or more of these topics.

Putting my learning into writing helps me internalize stuff better, so I decided to start a blog. If you find any errors, or would just like to discuss stuff, please send an email to john.gao@queensu.ca
