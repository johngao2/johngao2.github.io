title: Welcome to my Blog!
---

Hi! I'm John, a Canadian uni student. My primary research interests are machine learning and operations research. Pretty much all of my blog posts will cover one (or more) of these topics.

I feel like putting my learning progress in writing helps me internalize them better, which is why I decided to start this blog. I'll write at various levels of technical difficulty (which I'll specify for each blog post). However, since my knowledge of these things isn't that in-depth yet, I expect that even the more technical stuff will be mostly accessible.

The format of the posts here will alternate more or less randomly between surveys/reviews, paper summaries, code tutorials, and rambling. If you find any errors, or would just like to discuss stuff, please send an email to gaojohn23@gmail.com.
