title: Welcome to my Blog!
---

Hi! I'm John, a Canadian uni student. My primary research interests are machine learning (especially reinforcement learning) and operations research (especially revenue management & dynamic pricing). Pretty much all of my blog posts will cover one or more of these topics.

Putting my learning into writing helps me internalize stuff better, so I decided to start a blog. I'll write at various levels of technical difficulty, which I'll specify for each blog post. However, since my knowledge of these subjects isn't that in-depth yet, I expect that even the more 'technical' stuff will be accessible to most people.

The format of the posts here will alternate more or less randomly between surveys/reviews, paper summaries, code tutorials, and rambling. If you find any errors, or would just like to discuss stuff, please send an email to gaojohn23@gmail.com.

Cheers!
