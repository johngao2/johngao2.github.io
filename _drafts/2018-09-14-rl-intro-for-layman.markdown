In this post, I'll go over some of the basic fundamental theory behind reinforcement learning(RL). I'll try to do it in a way that should be accessible to anyone with basic math skills; as such, **the technical difficulty of this post will be pretty low**. I'll start by doing an overview of reinforcement learning in general terms, and then dive into technicals.

# Part 1: An Overview of RL


## What is RL?


Reinforcement learning has exploded in popularity in the past few years. Now it receives a staggering amount attention from both industry and academia, whereas 20 years ago it was a niche research field. I won't get much into the history of RL here, but it's actually super interesting, so you should read about it [here](http://incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/node12.html){:target="_ blank"}. Usually when an idea suddenly gets a large amount of traction, a lot of information gets lost in the process, which results in misinformation. As a result, theres still a lot of confusion about what constitutes RL. This is why I wanted to take this first section to address these misconceptions, and provide a unified definition for reinforcement learning.

Reinforcement learning is not just a single technique; it's actually a class of algorithms. Therefore, to define reinforcement learning, we would need to find something that binds this class of algorithms together. Here are some things that **fail** to define RL, but are commonly given as definitions:

1. **RL techniques are techniques that take delayed rewards into account.**  
    Although most reinforcement learning techniques do this,

## A quick history

Reinforcement learning as a concept mainly comes from two fields: optimal control, which is a part of control theory, and animal psychology.
